Up and Running on vert.x
========================

I decided to give [vert.x](http://vertx.io/) a shot at creating a basic application and I've

"[verticles](http://vertx.io/manual.html#concepts-in-vertx)" (which can be written in a
[variety of languages](http://vertx.io/examples.html)) via its
[Distributed Event Bus](http://vertx.io/core_manual_js.html#the-event-bus).

Let's see how this works out!
